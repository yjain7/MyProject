       " 'Watching the public dev calls there is a definite appearance of conservatism with regard to necessary upgrades. I think this is because consensus is so highly prized and people are reluctant to air disagreements in public. I think Hudson and other moderators need to do more to push debate, and ultimately votes, on more changes before defaulting to consensus if nobody talks in the calls, to help address the frustration Lane discusses of how hard it is to \"get things done\" in Ethereum due to political wrangling. \\n\\nTldr; the emphasis on consensus may be stifling the political friction and debate required to get positive upgrades through Ethereum\\'s governance process.

       " \"This graphic is really nice and well made, but it has some false info on it. ROI across all pool sizes are not all 5-6% per year. You can even see it for yourself using the AdaHeartPool calculator and looking at a pool size of 1M vs 20M (all else equal): [https://www.adaheartpool.com/about-us/](https://www.adaheartpool.com/about-us/)\\n\\nSuch a pool would give around 3% APY (assuming perfect pool performance and 0% marginal fees). This is pretty consistent with my analysis here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mxmigd/chance\\\\_of\\\\_zero\\\\_blocks\\\\_per\\\\_epoch/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mxmigd/chance_of_zero_blocks_per_epoch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\nOnly around 8.5M stake does a pool start to average around 5% APY, and it increases towards about 5.3% APY. Any pool below 100,000 ADA total stake is has below 3.5% ROI, which is significantly less than 5.3% ROI. In other words, if you were expecting to get 500 ADA this year from staking to a small pool, then after 73 epochs, you'll only have around 330 ADA in rewards. Whether that difference is 'big' or 'small' is up to the person staking, but it's better to have the correct information on this graphic. \\n\\nRight now, there are a lot of people who are quoting this graphic as if it were the truth, and that kind of misinformation will eventually push people away once they see how little ADA they're getting. The analysis I did showed that any pool with less than 15,000 ADA staked will expect to take over a year to make the first block. If newbies are staking to these small pools because they are being told that these are the pools that are best for decentralization, then they'll never make any rewards and may be turned away from ADA as a result of it. I can see that in a lot of the smaller pools, the ones who are delegating to them are newbies, so that's why I want to correct this misinformation.\",\n",

       "We have a lot of newcomers entering the Bitcoin space recently who are exploring different exchanges and such. Some users are developing a habit of asking if various random websites some complete stranger PM'd them is a scam or not. Sometimes these sites are completely unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not the purpose of r/Bitcoin.\\n\\n* Do not trust unsolicited messages telling you to check out some shady website.\\n* Do not trust Discord randos telling you that you won a prize.\\n* Do not trust anyone who promises guaranteed profits.\\n* Do not trust website with unpronounceable domain names\\n* Do not trust anyone claiming to give away free Bitcoin. (YouTube, Twitter, Discord)\\n* Do not trust anyone claiming they will double however much Bitcoin you send them.\\n* Do not trust 'pretty girls' on Tinder telling you about new investment opportunities.\\n* **If you have to ask** if some sketchy website or special offer is a scam, **then it probably is.**\\n\\nYou have to learn to think for yourselves. Recognize that there are many tricksters out there who will go to great lengths to separate you from your Bitcoin. Use your head and stay safe. If you send your Bitcoin to a scammer, it's gone forever.

       "This graphic is really nice and well made, but it has some false info on it. ROI across all pool sizes are not all 5-6% per year. You can even see it for yourself using the AdaHeartPool calculator and looking at a pool size of 1M vs 20M (all else equal): [https://www.adaheartpool.com/about-us/](https://www.adaheartpool.com/about-us/)\\n\\nSuch a pool would give around 3% APY (assuming perfect pool performance and 0% marginal fees). This is pretty consistent with my analysis here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mxmigd/chance\\_of\\_zero\\_blocks\\_per\\_epoch/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mxmigd/chance_of_zero_blocks_per_epoch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\nOnly around 8.5M stake does a pool start to average around 5% APY, and it increases towards about 5.3% APY. Any pool below 100,000 ADA total stake is has below 3.5% ROI, which is significantly less than 5.3% ROI. In other words, if you were expecting to get 500 ADA this year from staking to a small pool, then after 73 epochs, you'll only have around 330 ADA in rewards. Whether that difference is 'big' or 'small' is up to the person staking, but it's better to have the correct information on this graphic. \\n\\nRight now, there are a lot of people who are quoting this graphic as if it were the truth, and that kind of misinformation will eventually push people away once they see how little ADA they're getting. The analysis I did showed that any pool with less than 15,000 ADA staked will expect to take over a year to make the first block. If newbies are staking to these small pools because they are being told that these are the pools that are best for decentralization, then they'll never make any rewards and may be turned away from ADA as a result of it. I can see that in a lot of the smaller pools, the ones who are delegating to them are newbies, so that's why I want to correct this misinformation.                                                                                                                                                                                               0.033  0.857  0.111   0.9789   pos       1\n",
